Welcome to my hornet model's documentation! Here, I describe the motivation and methodology that was used to create, for example, this figure:

This an example of one possible outbreak scenario that was simulated. With it, is a logistic regression model that estimates the probability that an unconfirmed sighting of an Asian giant hornet is a real positive ID. When considered separately, the simulation and regression models may seem like little more than guesswork. When coupled and presented together though, they become much more convincing.
